## Overview

do you have any idea how long it took me to complete this challenge? and i'm not even that satisfied with the result! tailwind will be the death of me. i just know it. i feel it in my bones. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

I think by the end of this challenge tailwind is a bit less of a mystery than it was at the start. I also think ironically I would have completed the challenge a lot faster with regular CSS, but i'm proud of what it looks like after struggling with this damned tailwind so much!   

### Continued development

i want to focus on making the html more readable by reusing components and the js more clean by splitting it up in modules. i tried importing the constants from another js file to make it more tidy, but then it wouldn't work. I'll figure out why in another moment though because i really want to wrap this up after so long.
